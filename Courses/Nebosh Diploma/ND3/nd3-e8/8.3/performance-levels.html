          PL and SIL (if applied to machinery control systems), are both
          expressed in Probability of Failure per Hour (PFH). Both ratings also
          have requirements concerning structure, the degree of self-detection
          built into a device, and the confidence that design faults have been
          avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main difference between PL and SIL lies in the parameters that
          express those requirements. The PL not only has a PFH, but also a
          reliability value for each channel inside the safety-related system.
          This is called the Mean Time To dangerous Failure (MTTFd) of a
          channel.

              The Safety Integrity Level (SIL) is used to specify the integrity
              requirements of the safety functions to be allocated to the
              Electrical / Electronic / Programmable Electronic (E / E / PE)
              safety-related systems.

    <p>
      Performance Levels are only referenced in one standard, ISO 13849, however
      this is the pivotal standard as it is harmonised to the Machinery
      Directive. Safety Integrity Levels are referenced in IEC 61508 and all the
      other standards derived from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ability of Safety-Related Parts of Control Systems (SRP/CS) to perform
      a safety function under foreseeable conditions is allocated one of five
      Performance Levels (PL). These performance levels are defined in terms of
      probability of dangerous failure per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      To facilitate the assessment of achieved PL, EN ISO 13849-1 categorises
      control system structures into one of five classes of design architecture
      (B, 1, 2, 3, or 4) according to specific design criteria and specified
      behaviours under fault conditions as shown in the table below.

      To fulfil the requirements of category B The SRP/CS has to be designed,
      constructed, selected, assembled and combined in accordance with the
      relevant European standards (EN) and using basic safety principles for the
      specific application to withstand the expected operating stresses, however
      a single component (sub-unit) fault can lead to the loss of the safety
      function.

      Category 4 SRP/CS has a much greater level of reliability due to its dual
      channel architecture (redundancy) and fault monitoring systems. Category 4
      SRP/CS are designed so that:
