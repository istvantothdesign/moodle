<p>Hello {{first name}},
</p>
<p>We hope that you are enjoying your course and your online learning experience.
</p>
<p>We noticed that your course expires on {{ExpiryDate}}. If you need more time, then we are here to help. When you purchased the course, you had 12-months to complete the course content, register, and sit your NEBOSH exam.
</p>
<p>To help you pass the course, you may purchase a course extension that gives you an additional 12-months full access to the course content, access to all the online materials and access to Astutis ExamSmart™ and Astutis TrackSmart™
</p>
<p>The cost of the course extension and the NEBOSH exam registration is £375+VAT.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Do you need a bit more time to decide?</strong>
</p>
<p>We are committed to helping you pass, so after your course expires, you have an extra 60-days to get in touch so we can enrol you with this offer.
</p>
