      Welcome to your&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff6600"
        ><strong>Astutis IOSH&nbsp;Managing Safely</strong> </span
      >online learning course. You will already have received an email with your
      login details to the Astutis online&nbsp;learning website but&nbsp;this
      email is intended to highlight a few important things about your course.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #ff6600"
        ><strong
          >Start the course by working your way through the&nbsp;Overview and
          Support&nbsp;section</strong
        ></span
      >, this details how the course works, how you can find your way around and
      where to go for help. It also&nbsp;includes important details about the
      assessments.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #ff6600"
        ><strong
          >You have 6 months&nbsp;from today&nbsp;to complete the course,
          including the assessments</strong
        ></span
      >. If you do not complete the course in this time and require an
      extension, you will need to contact us for guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have completed the learning&nbsp;content,
      <span style="color: #ff6600"
        ><strong
          >you will initially have 2 weeks from the day you complete the
          learning materials&nbsp;section&nbsp;(or until the expiry date of your
          course, if this comes first)&nbsp;to complete&nbsp;both course
          assessments. If you do not&nbsp;complete them&nbsp;within the 2 weeks
          (or before the date of course expiry, if this comes first) this will
          be marked as a 'fail'.</strong

      ><strong> </strong>&nbsp;You will however be given 1 more opportunity to
      resubmit, once you have contacted us.
